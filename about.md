This project aims to explore the ways in which public memory of history is created and maintained through physical monuments. 
By using an extreme case of psuedo-history finding a receptive audience in a wealthy donor, I hope to create a lens through which we can examine all public monuments and better understand their purpose and context. 

### More Information

The project will consist of three primary parts: 

+ **An essay** providing historical context for the case study and making a case for its relevance
+ **A searchable database** of historical monuments in the greater Boston area
+ **A rubric** that the user can use to analyze datapoints and better understand their context
